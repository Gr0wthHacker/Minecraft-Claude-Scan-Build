# mctest — Minecraft island tooling

Two halves that share one file format:

- **`chunkscan/`** — a client-side Fabric mod (MC 26.2). Captures the world you can see into
  `.litematic` + `.scan.json`, places designs in Litematica, marks coordinates, highlights dig lists,
  indexes containers.
- **`mcbuild/`** — Python. Generates, audits, costs and diffs schematics against those captures.

Everything is anchored in **world coordinates** carried by the `.scan.json` sidecar next to every
`.litematic`. That sidecar is the contract between the two halves. No sidecar → no world position.

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Game | Minecraft **26.2**, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, **LiquidLauncher** (CCBlueX) |
| Server | `skyblock.net`, **Minecraft 1.19**, `minecraft:overworld`, player `Enroniti` |
| ⚠ Version split | The client is **26.2**, the server is **1.19**. A block added after 1.19 is in the client registry, has legal states, renders in a card, passes every audit — and **cannot be placed**. `mcbuild/data/server_blocks.json` is the allowlist; `blocks.available()` is the check. |
| Mods folder | `%APPDATA%/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher/data/custom_mods/nextgen-26.2/` |
| Schematics | `%APPDATA%/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher/data/gameDir/nextgen/schematics/` |
| Java | no system JDK — `JAVA_HOME=%APPDATA%/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher/data/runtimes/temurin_25/jdk-25.0.3+9-jre`; Gradle provisions JDK 25 into `~/.gradle/jdks` |
| Python | numpy, Pillow, PyYAML only. Run `python -m mcbuild <cmd>` from the repo root |

Paths live in **`profile.yaml`** (`mcbuild/profile.py` holds the defaults). Never hard-code them again.

**MC 26.x is unobfuscated** — mods use Mojang names directly, no yarn. Things that differ from older
guides: `ChunkPos` is a record (`x()`/`z()`), `Level.isClientSide()` is a method, chains are
`iron_chain`, Fabric client commands come from `ClientCommands.literal/argument`, there is no
`Minecraft.screen` accessor (use `ScreenEvents.AFTER_INIT`), chat via `player.sendSystemMessage`.
**Always `javap` the real jar before assuming an API** — it is faster than a failed build:
```bash
javap -cp ~/.gradle/caches/fabric-loom/26.2/minecraft-client.jar net.minecraft.world.level.Level | grep -i something
```

## The block knowledge base

Nothing about blocks is remembered — it is extracted from the game and checked in:

```bash
# 1. Mojang's own data generator: registry + every legal block state
java -cp "<client.jar>;<every jar under ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2>" net.minecraft.data.Main --reports --output <dir>
# 2. that, plus the client jar's textures, into mcbuild/data/blocks.json
python tools/extract_blocks.py --reports <dir>
```

Java `@argfile` needs **forward slashes** — it treats `\` as an escape. The JDK is `~/.gradle/jdks`
(the launcher's runtime is a JRE: no `javap`, no `jar`).

`audit` now validates every emitted state against this, so an illegal block state fails a test here
instead of Litematica silently refusing it in game an hour later. Wiring it up immediately found five
generators emitting `chain` (renamed `iron_chain` in 26.x), barrels carrying chest properties
(`type`/`waterlogged` instead of `facing`/`open`), and `lily_pad[rotation=0]` — lily pads have no
properties at all in 26.2.

## Build & test

```bash
python -m pytest -q                                   # 17 tests, keep green
cd chunkscan && ./gradlew build test -q                # writes build/libs/chunkscan-<ver>.jar
python chunkscan/verify_synthetic.py                   # Java writer vs Python reader, block for block
```
Jack uploads the jar through the launcher himself — **do not copy it into `custom_mods/`**, that
creates a duplicate mod id and Fabric refuses to start.

## The daily loop

```bash
python -m mcbuild sync            # cut the newest scan, regenerate ground designs, progress + shop, learn
```
`sync.yaml` says which designs regenerate and which get reported. After that:

```bash
python -m mcbuild progress <design...> --world out/island_now.litematic
python -m mcbuild shop <design...> --world out/island_now.litematic --have
python -m mcbuild card <design> --world out/island_now.litematic     # one PNG for chat
python -m mcbuild diff <old scan> <new scan>
```
In game: `/cscan island` to scan, `/cscan place` to place every design at its recorded origin.
While building:
```
/cscan need <design>     materials for the unbuilt cells within 48 blocks + which chest holds each
/cscan next <design>     the next 24 cells, marked green, lowest first so you never build past reach
/cscan check <design>    cells where the world holds something else, marked amber
```
These read `<design>.work.json`, so run `python -m mcbuild work <design> --ship` if you hand-edit a
design without regenerating it.

## Architecture

**`mcbuild/`**
- `nbt.py` / `schem.py` — Litematica v7 NBT, straddling bit-packed block states, `Model(ids[y,z,x], palette)`.
- `scan.py` — `.scan.json` sidecars: `load`, `cut` (world-coord sub-box), `merge`, `save_pair`.
- `coop.py` — `progress`, `remaining`, `diff`, `merge_scans`, `shop`, `card`, `place`, `sync`, `storage`.
- `blocks.py` — **what the game says about blocks**, from `data/blocks.json`: 1196 blocks, all 32366
  legal states, and the real colour of 1193 of them. `validate` (is this state legal), `is_full_cube` /
  `supports_top` / `falls`, `nearest` / `ramp` (pick blocks by colour out of the whole registry).
  Regenerate with `tools/extract_blocks.py` when the game updates — see below.
- `audit.py` — placement validity, geometry, cost tiers. Rules **learn from real captures**.
- `learn.py` — mines (block, relation, support) triples into `mcbuild/data/observed.json`.
- `gen/` — one module per generator, registered in `gen/__init__.py`; `belly.py` (island underside),
  `vertical.py` (taproot, shard + the `World`/`Ctx` helpers), `dressing.py` (hem, paths, lightposts,
  entrance, ridelights, apiary, birdlanterns, chimney, footing, altar), `interior.py` (the deck vault),
  `courtyard.py` (the sky-well court), `redstone.py` (item sorter), `coat.py` (patterned hide:
  Voronoi patches with grout, and soft blotches), plus the older statue generators.
- `work.py` — `<design>.work.json`: the design flattened to world-coordinate cells so the mod can diff
  it against the live world without an NBT reader. Written on every `gen`, shipped with the design.
- `history.py` — `out/history.json`, one row per sync, so `progress` has a slope: blocks per sync and
  how many syncs are left.
- `pipeline.py` — `run_config` → source → polish → finish → save; handles `verify_against` and `origin_lock`.

**`chunkscan/`** (client only, `src/client/java/dev/jack/chunkscan/`)
`ChunkScanClient` (commands) · `WorldCapture` (chunks → `Capture`) · `LitematicWriter` (NBT out) ·
`SidecarWriter` · `ScanRunner` (glue + archive) · `Litematica` (reflection bridge, soft dependency) ·
`Markers` · `Storage` + `ContainerWatcher` (container index) · `Highlight` (particles) · `AutoScan` ·
`Designs` · `Work` (reads `.work.json`, diffs against the live world).

## Rules that were learned the hard way

1. **One origin for everything.** Every design is padded to `origin_lock` (currently `-24251 150 29949`)
   so regeneration can never move it. Before this, a design's origin was its content bounding box and it
   shifted a block or two between runs — that produced hours of "the placement is misaligned", posts
   floating over slabs, etc. If a design must sit elsewhere, set `origin_lock: false` in its config and
   say so loudly.
2. **Verify in context, never in isolation.** `finish.verify_against: <capture>` composites the design
   onto the real world and audits *that*: overlap must be 0, placement problems 0. It also reports
   free-floating clusters (blocks with nothing to place against — they need scaffolding).
3. **The audit learns.** `python -m mcbuild learn <capture>` mines what the server actually allows
   (lanterns on fences, carpet on leaves, upper-half tall grass) into `observed.json`. Hand-written
   placement rules were wrong about real builds ~28 times on the first island. Feed it new captures.
4. **Designs are remaining-work.** Ground-level designs regenerate against the newest scan and emit only
   what is not built yet. Anything placed by *spacing* rather than per-cell (light posts) must seed its
   spacing from what already exists, or it re-picks new positions and doubles up.
5. **`progress` distinguishes three things**: built (loose families — any rock variant, any decorative
   slab counts), *clear first* (a plant/carpet/vine occupies the cell), and a real deviation.
6. **Prep lists live in the sidecar**: `dig` (blocks to remove), `clear` (whole categories, e.g. vines),
   `exclude_boxes` (decor to re-hang). `/cscan dig <design>` shows them in game.
7. **The capture frame is correct** — verified against Litematica's own recorded placement origins
   (Dragonfly matched 86/89 blocks). If coordinates look wrong, suspect a stale file, a remembered
   rotation/mirror on the placement, or a locked placement — not the frame.
8. **`mcbuild place` needs the game closed** (Litematica rewrites its config on exit). `/cscan place`
   in game does not — prefer it.
9. **Anything that clings needs a FULL block, tested against the world as it is today.** Belly hung
   three vines off the vault's wall railings because "solid" meant "not air" and the anchor test ran
   against the pre-build baseline. Use `audit._is_solid_name`, and test against `world`, not `under`.
10. **Leave ~3 blocks of working room around anything you use.** Unless a design is deliberately
   about storage, it must not come within about 3 blocks of a chest, barrel, furnace, hopper or
   workbench — you need room to stand, open the thing and walk past it. Derive that clearance from
   the capture (`container_clear`), never from a hand-written box: the storage moves and the box
   goes stale the same day.
11. **Ask the game, not your memory.** `blocks.py` beats a hand-written table every time. The
   `palette.COLORS` list had ~150 typed-in RGBs and everything outside it rendered **magenta** —
   three renders in one session were silently wrong. `_is_solid_name` had a suffix heuristic that
   called a slab solid, which hid a vine hung off a slab roof in `farm`. Both now defer to the
   registry. When a rule and the game disagree, the game is right: chains were being audited for
   support they do not need (`ChainBlock` never overrides `canSurvive`), while lanterns standing on
   slabs were being rejected even though `canSupportCenter` accepts them.
12. **Build for the SERVER's version, not the client's.** 26.2 client, 1.19 server. `pink_petals`
   sailed through every check in the pipeline and is a 1.20 block. `blocks.candidates()` filters to
   the server list by default. The allowlist is currently **provisional** — built from what the
   captures happen to contain plus a curated seed, so it holds ~191 of 1.19's blocks and would reject
   `allium`. Because of that the audit only *reports* unavailable blocks; it does not fail on them
   until a real 1.19 registry dump is supplied:
   ```bash
   # download a 1.19 server jar, then, as with 26.2:
   java -cp "<1.19 server jar>;<libs>" net.minecraft.data.Main --reports --output <dir>
   python tools/server_blocks.py --reports <dir>     # flips it to authoritative; the gate goes hard
   ```
13. **Gravity blocks cannot be used in anything with air under it.** `red_sand` is the best ochre in
   the game and cheap — and it would have poured the giraffe into the void. `blocks.falls` keeps sand,
   gravel, concrete powder and the rest out of `candidates()` unless you ask for them.
14. **Proportion names an animal; detail does not.** The giraffe was rebuilt three times. What fixed
   it was neck > body length, legs ≈ neck, and a back that drops hard from withers to hips — not more
   blocks. And a giraffe's coat is a **Voronoi diagram with pale grout**, not noise: value noise makes
   merging clouds that read as a cow, because the thing that identifies the animal is a *boundary
   between regions* and value noise has no regions.
15. **Overlap means the world holds something DIFFERENT.** A design cell the world already matches is
   built, not a collision — otherwise every design reports hundreds of overlaps the moment you build it.

## The island (as of 2026-08-18)

Plate at **Y201/202**, ~4,100 columns, one main lobe plus NW tree island, NE shrine lobe, SE mushroom
lobe. A working deck hangs at **Y190–199** (spawners, hoppers, chests, rail loop) and a rail line runs
out to the east lobes. Sky bird at **Y251–268**. Everything below the plate now gets the belly.

Landmarks: tree trunk `-24207..-24192 / 30012..30024` · pond `-24205..-24193 / 30002..30010` ·
deck ladder (vines) `-24190, 29991` · owl `-24248..-24230 / 30011..30031` (hollow, contains the altar) ·
fox `-24240..-24230 / 30000..30011` · bee house `z30036..30048` · gecko on the deck's east face
`-24177..-24173`.

Designs and where they stand: see `python -m mcbuild sync`. Belly ~46% built, rim hem ~50%, paths ~43%,
light posts 24 standing, altar started; taproot, shard, chimneys, ride lights, apiary, bird lanterns and
statue footings not started. ~5,400 blocks left, 3.1 shulkers, all cheap tier + 133 iron chain.

## Working style for this project

- **Design decisions are Jack's.** Propose, give numbers, recommend one option, then build what he picks.
  He cut the clouds and stepping stones after an audit said they were clutter — that judgement was right.
- The island is at **focal-point saturation**. New work should be connective tissue (paths, lighting,
  rim, dressing), not new large objects, and never more sky.
- Verify before claiming. Every design gets an in-context audit; every claim about the world comes from a
  capture, not from memory.
- Prefer generating from the capture over hand-placing coordinates. When a coordinate is needed, ask Jack
  to `/cscan mark <label>` it rather than guessing from a scan — guessing put a chimney on a torch once.
