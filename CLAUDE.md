# mctest — Minecraft island tooling

Two halves that share one file format:

- **`chunkscan/`** — a client-side Fabric mod (MC 26.2). Captures the world you can see into
  `.litematic` + `.scan.json`, places designs in Litematica, marks coordinates, highlights dig lists,
  indexes containers.
- **`mcbuild/`** — Python. Generates, audits, costs and diffs schematics against those captures.

Everything is anchored in **world coordinates** carried by the `.scan.json` sidecar next to every
`.litematic`. That sidecar is the contract between the two halves. No sidecar → no world position.

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Game | Minecraft **26.2**, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, **LiquidLauncher** (CCBlueX) |
| Server | `skyblock.net`, **Minecraft 1.19**, `minecraft:overworld`, player `Enroniti` |
| ⚠ Version split | The client is **26.2**, the server is **1.19**. A block added after 1.19 is in the client registry, has legal states, renders in a card, passes every audit — and **cannot be placed**. `mcbuild/data/server_blocks.json` is the allowlist; `blocks.available()` is the check. |
| Mods folder | `%APPDATA%/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher/data/custom_mods/nextgen-26.2/` |
| Schematics | `%APPDATA%/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher/data/gameDir/nextgen/schematics/` |
| Java | no system JDK — `JAVA_HOME=%APPDATA%/CCBlueX/LiquidLauncher/data/runtimes/temurin_25/jdk-25.0.3+9-jre`; Gradle provisions JDK 25 into `~/.gradle/jdks` |
| Python | numpy, Pillow, PyYAML only. Run `python -m mcbuild <cmd>` from the repo root |

Paths live in **`profile.yaml`** (`mcbuild/profile.py` holds the defaults). Never hard-code them again.

**MC 26.x is unobfuscated** — mods use Mojang names directly, no yarn. Things that differ from older
guides: `ChunkPos` is a record (`x()`/`z()`), `Level.isClientSide()` is a method, chains are
`iron_chain`, Fabric client commands come from `ClientCommands.literal/argument`, there is no
`Minecraft.screen` accessor (use `ScreenEvents.AFTER_INIT`), chat via `player.sendSystemMessage`,
`ResourceLocation` is **`Identifier`**, and **`Blocks.GRAY_WOOL` does not exist** — the sixteen
dyed families are `ColorCollection`s now, so it is `Blocks.WOOL.pick(DyeColor.GRAY)`.
`InteractionResult` is a **sealed interface**, not an enum (`SUCCESS`/`FAIL`/`PASS` are constants
on it), and both `UseBlockCallback` and `AttackBlockCallback` return one.
**Always `javap` the real jar before assuming an API** — it is faster than a failed build:
```bash
javap -cp ~/.gradle/caches/fabric-loom/26.2/minecraft-client.jar net.minecraft.world.level.Level | grep -i something
```

## The block knowledge base

Nothing about blocks is remembered — it is extracted from the game and checked in:

```bash
# 1. Mojang's own data generator: registry + every legal block state
java -cp "<client.jar>;<every jar under ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2>" net.minecraft.data.Main --reports --output <dir>
# 2. that, plus the client jar's textures, into mcbuild/data/blocks.json
python tools/extract_blocks.py --reports <dir>
```

Java `@argfile` needs **forward slashes** — it treats `\` as an escape. The JDK is `~/.gradle/jdks`
(the launcher's runtime is a JRE: no `javap`, no `jar`).

`audit` now validates every emitted state against this, so an illegal block state fails a test here
instead of Litematica silently refusing it in game an hour later. Wiring it up immediately found five
generators emitting `chain` (renamed `iron_chain` in 26.x), barrels carrying chest properties
(`type`/`waterlogged` instead of `facing`/`open`), and `lily_pad[rotation=0]` — lily pads have no
properties at all in 26.2.

# ANIMALS

Everything below concerns `gen/quadruped.py` and the taxonomy around it. It is the largest subsystem
and the one with the most hard-won detail, so it is documented as a whole rather than in pieces.

## The shape of the system

```
mcbuild/data/families.yaml   proportions + geometry choices, ONE table per family
mcbuild/data/species.yaml    a species = family + height + a coat + a few deltas (~6 lines)
mcbuild/gen/taxonomy.py      resolve(species) -> params, DERIVED as proportion x height
mcbuild/gen/quadruped.py     the build: mass -> relax -> features -> face -> coat
mcbuild/gen/anatomy.py       per-family LEG and HEAD geometry
mcbuild/gen/loft.py          superellipse sections swept along a spine; surface probing
mcbuild/gen/coat.py          voronoi / rosettes / blotches / shade
mcbuild/gen/smooth.py        relax + roughness metrics
mcbuild/data/rubric.yaml     the quality standard
```

A config only says WHERE the animal stands:

```yaml
gen: quadruped
params: {profile: jaguar, pose: sitting, feet: [...], look_at: [...], under: <capture>}
```

**Proportions belong to the FAMILY, not the species**, and block dimensions are DERIVED from them, so
a species is correct by construction rather than by tuning. Per-species tuning does not scale and does
not work: every animal tuned alone drifted toward whatever shape the smoothing and the block grid
preferred, and the silhouette test kept catching it — a bear that measured as a jaguar. Nothing in a
per-species dict says "a bear must sit where bears sit relative to cats". A family table says it once.

**Within a family, species differ by feature and colour, not by proportion.** A lion is a leopard with
a mane. So `silhouette` in the rubric is two-level — family separation by proportion, species
separation by coat and features — and scoring a lion and a jaguar as identical SHAPES is the metric
being right. Their distinction has to come from the mane, and it must be built big enough to break
the outline or it does nothing.

**But numbers alone build one animal five times.** Family proportions were not enough: a lion and a
jaguar came out 0.032 apart on silhouette. Each family also picks its own LEG and HEAD geometry from
`anatomy.py` — `plantigrade` legs put a bear on a long flat foot, `broad` gives it a wide skull with a
step down to the muzzle. That structure is what the numbers cannot reach.

## The build order (load-bearing)

1. **mass** — legs, body, neck, head lofted; nothing thin, nothing coloured
2. **relax** — cellular smoothing over that mass alone
3. **features** — mane, ears, horns, tail, trunk; *after*, because the rule that shaves a one-block
   pimple off a shoulder eats a horn whole
4. **face** — read off the SMOOTHED skin with `loft.surface_out`, never from a computed radius
5. **coat** — the pattern, over the finished shape

Anything derived from the standing skeleton must follow the POSED one: leg length sets the belly line,
and the belly line sets the countershading. Getting that wrong leaves legs floating under a hovering
barrel, or pale bands round a sitting cat's knees.

## Stance

`POSES` holds standing / sitting / couchant / prowling / grazing as multipliers — fore and hind legs
shorten independently, the belly line tilts, the neck is re-aimed. No pose is a separate build path.

`tools/stance.py <config> --from X Y Z` scores every pose on four measured things and says why:
**behaviour** (what the species does, from the family table — a sitting giraffe is a sick animal, not
a style choice), **site** (each pose is BUILT and its real contact footprint tested against the relief
under it), **legibility** (silhouette height against viewing distance; past ~30 blocks a couchant
animal is a lump), and **anatomy** (does it survive the build). They disagree often, which is the
point.

`leg_phase` and `head_turn` add deliberate asymmetry and are RECORDED, so the rubric relaxes its
symmetry expectation by exactly what was asked for. A diagonal leg phase is genuinely left-right
asymmetric and costs ~25 points of symmetry — rarely worth it; a head turn costs ~3.

## How big it has to be

`tools/scale.py <species>` — every feature needs a minimum block count to read, and every feature is a
fixed fraction of height, so `min_blocks / fraction` gives the height below which it cannot exist.
The largest such height is the animal's critical size.

    felid 23 · ursid 26 · caviomorph 23 · proboscid 30 · giraffid 59

(ursid was 24 under the old, wrong ursid proportions; correcting them moved it to 26. The floors
move when the tables do, so read them from the tool, not from here.)

**It is not the biggest animal that must be built big, but the one with the finest features relative
to its own size.** A giraffe's leg is 5% of its height so a 3-block leg forces 59 blocks of giraffe;
a jaguar's is 13%, so the same leg forces 23.

`--measure <config>` builds at a range of scales and reports the real curve. **Size sets a ceiling;
tuning sets the plateau.** You cannot tune past the size floor and you cannot size past a wrong ratio.

A second floor matters as much: a feature at its minimum EXISTS but carries no structure. A bear at
24 has a 6-block head — one above the floor — with no room for a broad skull and a stepped muzzle. It
took 30 before the family geometry could show.

## The quality standard

`mcbuild/data/rubric.yaml`; `python tools/rubric.py <design>` scores against it.

**Gates first, and they are not trade-offs**: one connected piece, grounded, no placement problems, no
functional blocks used as skin, every feature above its legible block floor. Fail one and no score is
printed.

Then seven weighted dimensions — **proportion** .22 · **silhouette** .16 · **form** .16 ·
**features** .15 · **surface** .12 · **palette** .10 · **symmetry** .09 → reference ≥.90, good ≥.78,
acceptable ≥.65.

**The reference is the BUILD'S OWN INTENT, not a standing table.** The generator records a
`designed` block in every sidecar — its target proportions as fractions of its own posed height —
and `proportions.designed()` reads it. Before this the audit re-derived what a pose does with a
parallel first-order model, and the two diverged badly: measured-over-wanted hit **2.97** on a
sitting bear's leg width and **1.86** on a prowling jaguar's neck, because `fold` widens a limb
about three times as much as the model assumed and `drop`/`lean` re-aim the neck without it
knowing. There was a per-FAMILY bias on top — a standing bear read +10..20% where a standing
jaguar read −5% — so no single standing table could serve both. It is the same rule
`proportions.measure` and `rubric.score` already follow: one source, so two tools cannot drift.
`posed()` remains as the fallback for older builds and for the sizing tools, which must answer
"how big must this be" with no build in hand.

Three things had to follow from it:

- **Verticals are measured from the FEET.** Legs seek their own ground, so on rolling terrain the
  downhill limbs reach below the nominal feet and the model's origin sits under them. Measuring
  from the origin compared two different zeroes and inflated every vertical on the lowland jaguar,
  while the horizontals matched exactly — that asymmetry is the tell.
- **`tilt_slack` has a FOLD term, not just a tilt term.** Couchant folds both legs almost equally,
  so a slack built only on the fore/hind difference saw 0.09 and allowed 34% where the build was
  46–60% off. Every couchant animal was marked deformed for lying down correctly.
- **A measure the pose cannot yield is OMITTED, not zeroed.** A couchant animal's floor is two
  courses up, so the window that should hold only legs holds the barrel too; `leg width` is absent
  rather than wrong, and the dimension is scored out of what could be taken.

And one that is not about pose at all: **a mane is not back.** A lion's mane is a 1000-cell ball
centred over the withers, and taking the greater of shape and design measured the mane and called
the barrel 50% too deep. Where a ruff is recorded, the withers falls back to the designed back
line — the same reason `anat_top_y` already excludes crown features.

- **form** asks whether the skin carries light — tonal range, and whether luminance follows sky
  exposure. Measured on BINNED means so a coat pattern does not destroy it. It is what separates a
  statue from a coloured shape.
- **features** reads `features_built` from the model's own sidecar — the generator counts cells as it
  emits them. It caught the giraffe's 6-cell ossicones and 3-cell mane as too small to see.
- **symmetry** mirrors across the sagittal plane the recorded FACING defines, and allows for
  asymmetry that was deliberately asked for.

Four questions are printed rather than scored, because a number cannot settle them. Answer them
yourself before shipping.

## The process, in order

```bash
python tools/scale.py <species>                    # 1. how big does it have to be
# ... write ~6 lines in species.yaml ...
python -m mcbuild gen configs/<x>.yaml --ship      # 2. build
python tools/stance.py configs/<x>.yaml --from ... # 3. which pose
python tools/rubric.py "<design>"                  # 4. score it; read the WEAKEST dimensions
python tools/refine.py configs/<x>.yaml            # 5. sweep, scored by the WHOLE rubric
python tools/compare.py --family <family>          # 6. against its SIBLINGS, not just the table
python tools/views.py "<design>" --zoom 10         # 7. LOOK at it. Always.
python tools/look.py "<design>"                    # 8. ...and in 3D, from every bearing
python tools/panel.py "<design>"                   # 9. and have it REVIEWED - see below
```

**Never tune one dimension.** Sweeping `smoothness.py` alone took the bear's surface 0.60 → 0.73 and
its proportion 0.88 → 0.50: every smoothing pass rewards thickening, so it inflated the animal until
the silhouette test called it an elephant, and the total *fell*. `refine.py` sweeps the same
parameters against the weighted rubric and prints what each dimension gained or lost.

**And always look.** The rubric passed a bear, a lion and a polar bear at GOOD when all three were
visibly the same animal — because `silhouette` compares each model to a reference TABLE and nothing
compared the models to EACH OTHER. Numbers did not catch it; one glance did.

## Traps, each of which cost a rebuild

- Smoothing **welds legs together** — two surfaces across a narrow gap look exactly like a dent.
  `relax(forbid=...)` bars the air between them, but the reach must cover the leg's *widest* section
  or it carves the haunch off instead, and it must be clamped to half the leg spacing or it protects
  nothing. `fold` widens a leg, so spacing must be computed from the FOLDED radius.
- Smoothing **eats thin limbs**: `keep` counts neighbours a slender leg does not have. Legs go in as
  `protect`.
- **Feature sizes must scale.** A tail hardcoded at 13 blocks was longer than a deer's legs and broke
  the model in two. Anything in absolute blocks has this latent.
- **Anything clinging must be ANCHORED to the built surface**, never placed at a computed radius —
  relax moves the surface. The mane came off as seven floating fragments, the ossicones detached, the
  tail floated 45 cells clear. `loft.surface_out` and `loft.crest` exist for this.
- **6-connectivity**: a swept feature whose cells are only diagonal neighbours is not connected. Ear
  tips broke off this way.
- **Palette by measurement** — `blocks.nearest()` over all 1193 real colours. Avoid functional blocks
  (`bee_nest` is the closest golden tan in the game and carries a face texture and bee states).
  Sandstone does not exist on this skyblock.


## Build history

Detailed build history, dated design notes, and past traps/fixes for this project live in `history/`. That content is NOT loaded here.

If the current task needs precedent for something specific (a past bug, a design decision, why a piece of code exists), read `history/INDEX.md` first to find the relevant entry, then read only that file with the Read tool. Do not read the full history/ directory or CLAUDE.md.full-history-backup.md -- the backup exists only in case something needs to be recovered from the split.

### Adding new entries (read this before writing a session summary)

Do not append build narrative, trap post-mortems, or dated session summaries
to this file. That is exactly how it grew to 16,887 lines / 1.1MB and made
every session in this project load ~280k tokens before any work started.

Instead: write the new entry as its own file at
`history/<next-number>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` (look at the last number in
`history/INDEX.md` and increment it), then add one line for it to
`history/INDEX.md`. If a finding is a durable rule that should apply to
every future session (not just a story about one build), add a short
bullet to the relevant section above instead — one line, not a narrative.
